# Flight_delay_prediction_and_analysis
This work is carried out using various info datasets available such as weather data which includes hourly and precipitation, all station weather data, train and test datasets. This is a classification problem, but the target column was not present in the datasets, here I had to create a target column using given EDA and feature engineering steps.  
In built libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, were used in this work.
In order to build a model and make prediciton, certain merging and feature engineering process is been carried out and files are saved separately in order to reduce the load on the system.
Here, coding was done through jupyter IDE and Google Collab workspace in order to manage the space and work both effecient and effectively. Upsampling was also carried out since the dataset was imbalanced and also to reduce the risk of overfitting.
Certain visualizations are plotted and analysis is done through visualizations, and model is build using RFR, Logistic Regression and SVC.
